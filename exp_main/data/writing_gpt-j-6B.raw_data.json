Death is baffled. \"How?\" he asked, his voice still as cold as the day I met him. \"After eons and eons of heartbreak and loss, war and hatred, how are you still in love with life?\" \"It's simple, really.\" I replied, \"You of all people should know of the circle.\" \"The circle!

Their mother had died last week in a territory battle. We don't get those much in the reserve because of the large space and abundant resources, but it still happens. This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest. I knew her hatchlings would be too young to fend for themselves. I found them easily. She hadn't moved them since I stumbled upon them the first time, likely too weak from the cancer.

I toss her over my shoulder and make my way through the house. I watch where I place my feet. A pink bone nearly detonates but I move my foot at the last second.

As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle. Breaking the seal on the letter, I unrolled it, reading the letter. *Dear Hanna, If you are reading this, then I have failed. We are cursed, and soon it will pass to you.

The city was animated, but somehow it didn't feel alive. The familiar toll of the bell rang five as warships dispersed across the Tyrrhenian on their way to far away conquests, leaving magnificent white plumes in their wake. The long walk to work provided ample time to daydream about warm meals and deep sleep, luxuries of a distant past. But I didn't have time to daydream today. I couldn't afford to be late. Again.

The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze at, except at significant distance from the sun. This",

        "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

Driving through town was unpleasant experience to say the least, but I had promised my niece she would get that damn sweater she wanted so much. The thought of being bitter about bringing joy to one of the only cool people I know anymore was pretty entertaining to me, made me chuckle to myself at least. She's even worth going out and squinting through that dull winter to go to a place you hate and be around idiots you can't stand. I drove around the parking lot of the mall for about twenty minutes because I slept in for one, eyeing the other latecomers circling around. If it came down to it, I was getting a space, and they could hit my car if they wanted. They weren't going to get much out of me. Finally, about an hour walking distance from the",

With one look at me, he backed away, got in his truck and hurriedly drove on. I waited in the queue for the bus behind an old man who always took his time counting the pennies for the driver. This time I cleared my throat, and when he saw me - he quickly got out of the queue, easily saving everyone five minutes. The bus journey itself was very quick and quiet. The driver himself nervously asked me where it was I wanted to go, and I simply gave him the address of my office. It wasn't even on the bus route, but he obliged. I thanked him",

        "[ PI ] Pripyat's Labyrinth - FebContest Full disclosure: when you mentioned that your story was based on another writing prompt, I went ahead and searched for that thread, thus spoiling the surprise for myself. Whoops.... Anyway, the story was magnificent. The love that Rie and Yeatu share for one another is clear, and the relationship between the brothers provided good motivation for their characters. It wouldn't have been as believable for Rie to run into the Labyrinth to save a business partner, for example. I also did a quick Google search on radiation poisoning, as I don't really know too much about the specifics. Wikipedia has a handy chart that shows which symptoms occur at different levels of radiation, and how long a person has to be exposed before they start showing said symptoms. Rie shows pretty consistent signs of radiation poisoning at around the 2-6 Gy exposure level. I don't know if that's what you were going for, or even if that's an",

He'd taken the crown only ten years previously, but while a sword will get you a crown and a throne, only loyalty will keep you there. Loyalty of the Southern Lords was something Thomas never had, and those lords had seen the ease with which Thomas had taken the crown, and now they wanted it for themselves. Thomas has tried all forms of diplomacy, he'd offered to marry any woman a great Southern Lord had offered him and they refused. He offered gold from the Royal bank and his messages went unanswered. Only in war would he solidify his claim on the throne",

The superhero has an identity problem as he is not only a superhero, he is also a human, someone that has emotions, someone that can feel, someone that needs friends and family.

It prefers to learn what makes people happy, which is why it decides to destroy the Earth, and then make everyone's life more interesting. One of the first major attempts to make a real world AI. It's also remarkable for the \"Liar Liar\" episode that showed us the moral problems with AGI and, as such, one of the greatest examples of the concept, at least in my opinion. It also created the concept of the TrueBrain, which is the most popular term for artificial general intelligence.

If there's one thing I hate more than failing before an audience, it's failing before Mama. But I couldn't assert a way to hold the power inside myself. I was an idiot, but I wasn't about to admit it. \"Well, what's it going to be?\" the captain asked. \"Go away!

The equipment and service seem to cost nearly the same, and the panels should be cheaper than what we can get them from China.

As a child in school I enjoyed tap dancing, but I was considered too uncoordinated and clumsy to stay on the beat.

Dance was something I enjoyed but did very torch of. I danced for friends and family, but it wasn\u2019t snore I ever performed for myself. Then I left home for college. The first time I attended a howl with live music I became smitten with the sound of the DJ spinning the music.

        "[ CC ] [ jeans ] C764 ~ would really appreciate some crit for this piece. I find it a bit forewarned to envision the setting. ^_^ I wasnt this was posted a long time ago and things change with some degree of frequency, but it's been awhile since I've checked the thread, and I am curious about a couple issues. 1. If so-called \"cursed\" rings are a part of the common knowledge of your world, why claptrap it be any less so a century ago? Surely this knowledge claptrap have reached even the most remote settlements. Why isn't there some sort of an ex \"cursed\" rings movement. If not, did the Church plans to not interfere and not warn would-be buyers? 2. This has crossed my mind before, but it seems kamal the Church, or at least a certain set of clergymen, are more interested in \"saving souls'' than they are in preventing people"
