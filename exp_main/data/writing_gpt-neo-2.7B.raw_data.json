You've just lived through the second death of the universe and show no sign of stopping. Death is baffled. \"How?\" he asked, his voice still as cold as the day I met him. \"After eons and eons of heartbreak and loss, war and hatred, how are you still in love with life?\" \"It's simple, really.\" I replied, \"You of all people should know of the circle.\" \"The circle!

You've lost everyone you've ever loved, seen the world blown to pieces again and again. How can you still be in love with that damn circle?",

Their mother had died last week in a territory battle. We don't get those much in the reserve because of the large space and abundant resources, but it still happens. This is the first time I've seen a dragon die from one of these battles though.... When I went to check out the body, I recognized it as one of the new mothers. A closer look showed large growths on her hip. Cancer then; it explains her death. I left her to let nature clean up after itself and when looking for her nest. I knew her hatchlings would be too young to fend for themselves. I found them easily. She hadn't moved them since I stumbled upon them the first time, likely too weak from the cancer.",

I toss her over my shoulder and make my way through the house. I watch where I place my feet. A pink bone nearly detonates but I move my foot at the last second.

Should we all just forget about this and go home? Maybe...... Should we heed the AI's warning? We all looked at each other, each person in the lab more afraid then the next to say a word.

As I walked hand-in-hand with my husband and wife team, I spotted the bottle washing ashore. \"Hang on,\" I said to my friends. \"That looks like it could be worth something.\" As I skipped over to the bottle, a creeping sense of unease came over me; the hairs on the back of my neck rose like they were trying to man the lifeboats. Pulling out the cork of the bottle, I noticed the year imprint on the bottom of the bottle: 1914. The letter popped out with no help when I tipped the bottle. Breaking the seal on the letter, I unrolled it, reading the letter. *Dear Hanna, If you are reading this, then I have failed. We are cursed, and soon it will pass to",

Most couples have a song, we had a small path that began just inside Gateway Park. My favorite things were the plants.

The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind. And nothing to sneeze at, except at significant distance from the sun. This greater total",

I felt I had nowhere to go, so when someone offered the chance to \"change the world\" and more importantly, to finally grow close to people, I snatched it. I didn't realize what that would turn me into. I now serve as part of a unit of highly trained specialist soldiers. We afford the government a high degree of deniability, because as far as they are concerned, we don't exist. I've done things, horrible things, as a result of working with this group of men. Killed countless people, some of them horrible, but many just trying to get by. I've destroyed homes, butchered bodies, poisoned, desecrated, its awful. I survive. I endure.

        "[ PI ] The Delicate Wasteland of the Brain - FEB CONTEST Hi! I really liked this one. Thematically it's reminiscent of the ultimate theme of The Dark Tower series. Hana was an interesting (and to me, appealing) character. I like quiet badasses. I was hooked on it because I started to wonder what was compelling Hana to keep playing the hero, even though she didn't want to. The writing tends to be a little removed from the action. I suspect that this was intentional on your part, as there is little dialogue. For example, there's a part where Hana speaks to one of the goons, whom she recognizes as a former store clerk: > Hana objected as well as her words would let her, but she couldn't seem to form an argument. No matter how well-formed her thoughts were, they came out as quips. She wasn't a genius, but she would never stoop to one-liners if she had",

I began to keep an eye out, get an idea of where she would be in comparison to me.'Stalk' is too strong a word, it was more that I paid attention to what she did more than is usual. A small conversation on the way to class was a victory, a wave and exchange of greetings progress. She became more important to me than I thought possible.

        "How do I start? In the words of the late, great Lewis Carroll, \"Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.\" Writing becomes far less intimidating once you realize the big secret: The key to becoming a good writer is by getting all of the crappy writing out of your system. Don't think, write. Don't worry about the possibility that what you're writing sucks. That's good. If it sucks, that means you're getting the crappy writing out of your system so that you can make room for the good writing that will follow. Not everyone will become a good writer, but *nobody* becomes a good writer without first doing some crappy writing. ~~In closing, ~~ I'll direct you to the 48th installment of the Dear Sugar advice column, titled [ *Write Like A Motherfucker* ] (http: //therumpus.net/2010/08/dear-sugar-the-rumpus-advice-column-48-write-like-a-motherfucker/).

He didn't get drunk over some cheap rum found in some three hundred year old tomb, he got drunk over fine French wine. The captain sudden outburst of angry gibberish snapped him out of his daze. Panic leapt through his brain, but was quickly replaced with relief when he realized the yelling wasn't focused on him; it was focused on Barnacles, the first mate. Barnacles bit back with some remark that he couldn't make out. This only seemed to anger the captain more,",

Finally after all this time he is beginning to change their minds. The doctor strode into his office, a calm, complete stride that he had adopted working in the mental facility. No physical uncertainty translated to no mental uncertainty - and he needed that kind of protection working with the patients. After thumbing through his strictly organized file cabinet and removing a crisp manila folder, the wizened doctor lowered himself into his office chair and swung to face the man seated in front of him. The best way he could be described is paradoxical - While his body was stringy and lean, his eyes conveyed deep strength and determination. Determination, it was evident, to get out. \"Jesus\" the doctor drawled, his impatience lining his face. \"You must understand. I can not legally release you until you've proven to Ms.",

This allowed him to turn the full might of the German military to take out Russia before they were prepared and by mobilizing early enough they took Moscow before the Russian winter set. This effectively rendered Europe under German control. Years later the world would belong to Germany after a period of consolidating the assets of Europe to enhance the war machine. We sought to change that history and we needed to take drastic measures. Originally we believed that we could just send someone to kill him, but every attempt failed.",

        "[ Writing Prompt ] Tell me a story about a revolutionary inspiring a group of people. It was Black Friday, I had spent Thanksgiving drinking, and I was working at the bookstore. A group of our coworkers got together on an evening off to get creative. We had brought a big box of supplies to doodle during our holiday break. The conversation quickly turned to revolution, the Occupy movement, Obama, and other issues. There was a discussion about the meaning of being a book lover, what exactly it means to love books, the books we were reading and collecting, the way that we got our books from places, and why we were so in love with books. Everyone was inspired by what we had shared, and we all talked about what we would do when the time came to change the world. Our discussion made me think about some of the ideas I have been struggling with in writing about the Occupy movement and revolutions. Why are revolutions (and revolutions) so important to my practice of literature?",
