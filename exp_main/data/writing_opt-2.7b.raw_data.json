The void between worlds is filled with breathable air at survivable pressure. Heat from the sun thins this to near-vacuum near its surface and heats it to plasma at nearby distances. Hot, charged gases are forced away along the sun's magnetic poles which in turn draws in cooler gases along the plane at 90 degrees to that, causing a convection current of sorts. Because of the varying nature of the sun's magnetic field, this current can be unpredictable and may in fact consist of multiple currents at once. The aggregate heat transfer that results from this convection means that, while the areas near the sun are an oven or worse, the habitable zone is huge. It also means that solar winds are, literally, wind.",

The bus driver will see a woman getting mugged and try to be a hero, only to get shot between the eyes. My neighbor's stupid dog will run into the street and be hit by an oncoming vehicle while chasing after a stick that he was playing with.

In the original history it was Hitler that won the war but in a much quicker and cleaner fashion. Hitler's blitzkrieg originally took Belgium and France too quickly and his u-boats were able to starve out the British out of supplies by practicing unrestricted naval warfare from the beginning. This allowed him to turn the full might of the German military to take out Russia before they were prepared and by mobilizing early enough they took Moscow before the Russian winter set. This effectively rendered Europe under German control. Years later the world would belong to Germany after a period of consolidating the assets of Europe to enhance the war machine.

It's not a perfect solution, but it could probably work a little bit.\nThat's awesome, I really like the idea of that, the borderless world and borderless city. Any particular reason why they would want to keep a physical border?\nHoping that the borderless world was more like a society and the boundary was a cultural convention. Also to not have to keep worrying about warring neighbours. :)\nThanks! It's hard to put yourself in my mind, so I hope I get the idea, but could you explain more what you mean by a society and cultural convention?",
        "As a dragon of innumerable age you have guarded your gold horde for millennium. Many heroes have come with long speeches on how they will slay you, but the odds were against them. You laugh as you watch them fall. Yet you keep it safe.\nAs someone who also plays as a dragon, this made me laugh a lot. My gold hoard never seems to be safe; I constantly have to guard it from marauders.\nYou have to keep the dragon alive then, by any means necessary. You are not worthy to defeat a dragon. The dragon will not let you win by mere strength, he will fight with cunning and stealth, then crush you with one single blow.\nI have the same thing happening to me, but I'm not a dragon.\nMaybe you are a dragon-in-exile, forced to flee after an untimely demise.\nOr maybe, just maybe, being the only character who thinks *that* would get old quickly.\n",

It\u2019s been five years since you first set foot on it, yet you remember nothing. Yet, just by sight alone, you knew, without a doubt, that the stars knew who you were. You were, in a word, famous. The stars knew your secret: how in the darkest depths of the blackest night at the darkest moments of the world\u2019s worst wars, you were as silent as the darkest night and you were as still as the very deepest silence. You were the one who walked beneath the shadow of every single combat and you kept the peace.

        "Follow-up: You are a compulsive dancer. Anywhere there is music playing you struggle to remain still. The disease began with me. I was 15 years old, and the only way to get out of my chair was to dance. My mother never understood, being an introvert and not a big dancer, why she couldn\u2019t do the same thing I loved. But I couldn\u2019t stop. In the first decade of my life, I was on the dance floor twice a week. I was lucky, because music was playing in my house. My mother did whatever it took to have enough of my music. In one week, our collection of 78 RPM records reached 100. After a while, I became so accustomed to this routine that it became a ritual. But something was still missing. No matter how many records I listened to or how many times I danced, the question, \u201cBut what do you like to do?\u201d Still remained. I was",

        "After the surface of earth has been made unfit for human life, humans have relocated to the bottom of the ocean. Oxygen is now our most important commodity, and we extract it from the ocean's depths with the technology of the deep seas research vessel Oceans 12. We need the cooperation of oceanographers and others in order to preserve the fragile environment of the oceans. However, this agreement for cooperation is violated by the sudden appearance of a new ship on track and under the command of an unknown military leader on the surface of the ocean near our shores. The only remaining hope for human survival is to build, in the waters of a deep ocean research station, a new ocean-based city that is equipped with everything necessary for long-term exploration and settlement.

Not even with my woman. The bio drop struck, and I had to stop the spell. Rain had failed. Not that I expected any spells to work in the rain, as they always did. My spell failed. I thumb around the parking lot for a few moments. A few even were drizzling. An residue hooted, and the wind tickled my hair. My shoes had slipped. I thumb at the book again and started to cry.

What are you trying to achieve here? \"In the end, they are but animals; more specifically, they are just animals that happen to make up society.\" The people who come away from the film having gotten \"good morals\" from watching a documentary about how evil \"nature\" is will be more likely to vote green, because it's good for the planet. If anything, they are less likely to realize how cruel (and perhaps unnecessary) the experiments or treatment procedures were. After all, how can something horrible be happening if it's to the good of the \"nature\"? People are less likely to buy good food if they think it comes at a premium price.

        "This world, but borderless and nationless. (I guess, I have to apologize for this reply, but my first you for this prompt was to come up with a way the characters could keep borders within borderless cities. It's not a perfect solution, but it could probably work a little bit. That's awesome, I really like the idea of that, the borderless world and borderless city. Any particular reason why they would want to keep a physical border? Hoping that the borderless world was more like a society and the boundary was a keep convention. Also to not have to keep put about warring neighbours. :) Thanks! It's hard to put yourself in my mind, so I hope I get the idea, but could you explain more what you mean by a you",

You let as you watch them fall. Yet you keep it safe. As someone who also let as a dragon, this made me laugh a lot. My let hoard never seems to be safe; I constantly have to guard it from marauders. You have to keep the dragon alive then, by any means necessary. You are not let to defeat a dragon.

It\u2019s been five years since you moments set foot on it, yet you remember nothing. Yet, just by sight alone, you knew, without a doubt, that the stars beneath who you were. You were, in a word, famous. The stars knew your secret: how in the darkest depths of the blackest night at the darkest moments of the world\u2019s worst wars, you were as silent as the darkest night and you were as still as the very deepest silence. You were the one who walked beneath the shadow of beneath single combat and you kept the peace.

I found it to be somewhat generic at the start of the project, I've find the beginning and I'd like feedback on that. No particular order, but in the order I saw this posted.

It could use a find overhaul, and it would have been better if you had linked straight to it in the first place, but it was the second on my list.
