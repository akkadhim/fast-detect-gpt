Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an expert on",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer.

On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head. She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties.

The review found there was \"inadequate resource management\" during the verification and count between 23 May and 25 May. Jenny Watson, chair of the Electoral Commission, said the problems were down to a \"failure in planning\". \"There were delays in getting counting staff and counting agents appointed by parties into the venue, then there were insufficient staff to be able to recover from that,\" she said. \"Fundamentally that meant a local election count that had planned to take six hours took 23 and a half hours.\" She said the commission would be monitoring the council's response to the review.

Massandra was Ukrainian government property before Russia's annexation of Crimea in March 2014. Any charges could not currently be pursued in Crimea, where Russia has full control. Russian media cited by Radio Free Europe reported that Berlusconi asked if he could sample the wine during a tour of Massandra. A witness said Massandra's new pro-Russian director Yanina Pavlenko in response uncorked a precious bottle of 1775 Jeres de la Frontera for her prestigious guests. Russian television last week showed Mr Berlusconi carefully surveying dust-covered bottles of wine while the Russian leader listened to Ms Pavlenko as she gave them the tour. Later, the Italian billionaire is seen looking at a bottle identified to be from the vintage of 1891, and asked in English: \"Is it possible to drink?\" The director replied: \"Yes.\" It is",

        "BBC One will show a special programme, Strictly Len Goodman, on Friday. The National Grid said the show would drive the biggest festive \"TV pickup\" - a sudden surge in electricity demand. The spike is largely down to viewers turning on lights and boiling their kettles straight after the programme. There is also a surge in the number of people going to the bathroom, which leads to a spike in the use of water companies' pumps, which draw electricity. The Great British Bake Off, the Strictly Christmas special and Call the Midwife are also expected to create high demand over the Christmas period. But TV surges create less demand now than they did 20 years ago because more people use catch-up services to watch TV and do not all see a programme live.

But what is it and why has it been taking the dance music world by storm? Surprisingly, the answer lies in the bus horns of Indonesia. Young people in Indonesia, amused by the local buses' customised horns, have been waiting by the side of the road for vehicles to pass, encouraging bus drivers to toot their horn when they did so. Videos depicting this craze have gone viral in Indonesia. Some held signs to better attract the attention of the driver - signs which said 'Om Telolet Om'. 'Telolet' is a word representing the sound of the buses' horns, while 'om' is a term for an older male, like 'uncle' or 'sir' in English. So 'Om Telolet Om' roughly translates as 'Sir honk your horn sir'. OK, but what has that got to",

The Department of Health said the NHS couldn't afford the union's demands. The government has given NHS staff a 1% pay rise, but not for those who get automatic progression-in-the-job increases. Those increases are given to about half of staff and are worth 3% a year on average. The decision by ministers went against the recommendation of the independent pay review board, which called for an across-the-board rise. The Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: \"NHS members don't take action often or lightly. \"For many of our members this will be the first time they walk out as the last action over",

SPFL rules forbid players from playing for their parent clubs if they return from lower-league loans after 31 March. United chairman Stephen Thompson has resigned from his position on the SPFL board in protest at the sanction. Having returned from loan spells from East Fife and Brechin respectively, Coote and Robson were not eligible to appear for United again until the start of next season. Dundee United pleaded guilty to breaches of SPFL Player Regulations 12, 14(i) and 14(ii), having failed to apply to register players as required by SPFL Player Regulations 7 and 3A.

        "The jury found Irek Hamidullin guilty on 15 counts, including supporting terrorists and conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction. The 55-year-old is the first military prisoner from Afghanistan to be tried in a US federal court. Some of the charges carry a mandatory life sentence. About 30 insurgents died in the attack, with Hamidullin the only survivor, while no American or Afghan soldiers were killed. Hamidullin, who did not testify during the trial, is expected to be sentenced on 6 November. Lawyers say it is unusual for someone captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan to be transferred to the United States for trial in a federal court. Hamidullin's defence lawyers had tried unsuccessfully to have the charges dismissed, saying their client was a prisoner of war and ineligible for trial in civilian court. Prosecutors argued federal law protected US soldiers no matter where they were. The jury in Richmond. Virginia, reached its verdict after five days of testimony and eight hours of",

But the carmaker says that the system it is using is \"not just safe, but very good for the driver and everyone around him.\"\n\nIf the system is indeed being used, then let us hope Mercedes-Benz have not overreacted, or rather underreacted, in adopting the ban, since it could do irreparable damage to its brand image.\n\nAnd what else needs to be seen is the \"no brake under acceleration\" system adopted for this year's F1 - a system that is just a \"very specific\" version of the one adopted last year.\n",

The judge on the transgender student's case sided with the transgender student, ruling that bathroom use and the ability to wear makeup are not violations of Title IX. The Justice Department, which was defending the Obama-era policy prohibiting discrimination, appealed the district for a nationwide injunction against it.\n\n\"I went into a women's room with makeup on, and nobody was staring at me or glaring at me, so I came out and was like, 'OK, thanks, I'm cool,'\" said Nicole Cressman, 17, talking of her experience at a girls\u2019 locker room last year. \u201cFor me, being trans is sort of like coming out.
