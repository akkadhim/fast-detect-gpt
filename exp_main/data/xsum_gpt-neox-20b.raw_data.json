Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer.

The report has also detailed a number of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme. Research by the IPPR showed only 47% of children born in the poorest families in the north of England achieved a good level of early years development compared with 59% in London.

The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT.

His absence has led to some anxiety in Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy, with people speculating about whether he will be able to resume his duties.

Researchers at dpart gathered evidence from two surveys of under 18s - one conducted in April and May 2013, and then a second conducted one year later.

Young people were less likely than adults to align themselves with political parties, but the proportion who said they did not feel an affinity to one dropped in the year before the vote, from 57% to 51%.

But it said he did not see settlements as an \"impediment to peace\" - a departure from previous US positions. The fate of settlements in the occupied West Bank is one of the most contentious issues between Israel and the Palestinians. More than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. Israel's pro-settlement government, which had sharp differences with the Obama administration on the issue, felt emboldened when Donald Trump took office last month. Since then, it has authorised 6,000 new settlement homes, in one of the biggest surges for years. On Wednesday Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was moving ahead with plans to",

Her report suggests that extending working lives would add \u00c2\u00a355bn a year to the UK economy. If everyone worked one year longer, it would add 1% to annual GDP, she says. \"Academic and historical evidence shows that, far from damaging job prospects, keeping more older people in work is associated with rising employment and wages for younger people,\" said Dr Altmann, a former adviser to 10 Downing Street. If older people keep working, the theory goes, they have more money to spend, and that boosts the economy, creating more jobs for everyone. Conversely, if older people stop work, there is less money in the economy, so fewer jobs. The idea is well-known to economists as the \"lump of labour fallacy\" - the false belief that the number of jobs in an economy is fixed.",
